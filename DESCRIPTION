Description: A package for fitting linear difference-in-differences models in 
  scenarios where intervention roll-outs are staggered over time. The package 
  implements a version of an approach proposed by Sun and Abraham to estimate
  cohort- and time-since-treatment specific difference-in-differences parameters, 
  and it provides convenience functions both for specifying the model and for 
  flexibly aggregating coefficients to answer a variety of research questions.
