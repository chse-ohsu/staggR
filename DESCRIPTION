Description: Fits linear difference-in-differences models in scenarios where
    intervention roll-outs are staggered over time. The package implements a 
    version of an approach proposed by Sun and Abraham (2021) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.006> to estimate cohort- and 
    time-since-treatment specific difference-in-differences parameters, and it 
    provides convenience functions both for specifying the model and for 
    flexibly aggregating coefficients to answer a variety of research questions.
