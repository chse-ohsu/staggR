#' Hospitalization data
#'
#' A simulated data set of 15 counties, 11 of which implemented a policy intervention during 2015 - 2018 to reduce hospitalizations. The data set is longitudinal, with each row corresponding to an individual-year.
#'
#' Consider a policy intervention designed to reduce inpatient hospitalizations in 15 counties. This longitudinal data set has one row per individual-year. Each individual is identified by a globally unique identifier (`guid`), and we have measures of the individuals' ages, sexes, and comorbidities, and a column indicating whether the individual was hospitalized during the current year.
#'
#' The column `intervention_yr` tells us the year during which each county implemented the intervention. If `intervention_yr` is `NA`, we can conclude that the county never implemented the intervention. Among the 15 counties, 3 implemented the intervention in 2015; 2 counties implemented in 2016; 5 counties implemented in 2017; 1 county implemented in 2018; and 4 counties did not implement the intervention at all during the study period, which runs for 11 years, from 2010 through 2020.

#' Aggregated hospitalization data

#' A simulated data set of 15 counties, 11 of which implemented a policy intervention during 2015 - 2018 to reduce hospitalizations. The data set is longitudinal and aggregated to county-year.
